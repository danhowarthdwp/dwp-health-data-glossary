## What is the measurement glossary?

The measurement glossary is a managed list of terms and phrases that we use in DWP Digital Health and Disability, with guidelines for their use. It’s also known as a controlled vocabulary.

Its aim is to make the language we use clear, so colleagues and stakeholders know what we mean when we talk about measurement.

## What is in it?

The glossary is in alpha, and we‘re adding more terms throughout spring 2022, as we research and define them.

Terms are listed alphabetically in an A to Z. Each term also has its own page with metadata that puts it in context and shows how it relates to other terms.

This table describes the metadata you’ll see for each term in the A to Z.

| Metadata | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Term name | The term or phrase that we propose to use |
| Definition | What the term or phrase means |
| Purpose | Why the term is important |
| Synonyms | Other words and phrases that might mean the same thing, that people use interchangeably and in different contexts |
| Parent term | If the term is part of a bigger group of terms, this lists the name of the group |
| Child terms | If the term has a group of terms underneath it, this lists the sub-terms |
| Source | Publication or document that is an authority on this term and its use |
