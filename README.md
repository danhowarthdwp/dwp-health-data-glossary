# DWP Health data glossary

This static site uses the [GOV.UK Eleventy plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/) to create a front-end for a controlled vocabulary / glossary of measurement language in DWP Digital Health and Disability.

We forked this repo from the wonderful [htmlandbacon](https://github.com/htmlandbacon/xgov-eleventy-sample), because we weren't able to install Eleventy by following the GOV.UK Eleventy plugin instructions.

This is a work-in-progress.
