## Definition

Metadata is data about [data](/a-to-z/data). It's usually a set of data that describes contextual information on another set of data. It helps to organise, find, understand and manage data.


## Purpose

Metadata makes it much easier to find, manage and understand data. 

For example, this glossary is full of metadata about terms. It puts terms in context and makes them easier to understand by putting definitions, purpose and related terms in a clear and consistent structure that you can search.
