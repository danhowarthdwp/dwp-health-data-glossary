## Definition

Linked data is structured data that uses common standards and identifiers to allow multiple datasets to be used in conjunction with each other. It requires a common data model, and to follow technical and data standards that enable the use and [interoperability](/a-to-z/interoperability) of the data model.

## Purpose

If a whole is greater than the sum of its parts, that's because the way different parts combine create something new and valuable. It's the same with linked data â€“ it helps build a bigger, clearer and more accurate picture of something. For example, linking data from PIP and ESA applications might help to provide a clearer picture of a claimant's capability for work, and thus help make decisions fairer and more robust.
