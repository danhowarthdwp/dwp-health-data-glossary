## Definition

A unit of measurement that measures [performance](/a-to-z/performance). It shows how effectively we're performing an activity, opportunity or lever that we've defined. 

David Parmenter defines performance measures as being tied to a team or a cluster of teams working closely together for a common purpose. Good or bad performance becomes the responsibility of one team – which therefore provides clarity and ownership. Performance measures show what teams are delivering.

## Purpose

Success depends on lots of things working independently and in a chain at different levels. Performance measures let us see how effectively they're working at a granular level, so we can see where to improve and allocate more resources.
