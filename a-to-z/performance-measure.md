## Definition

A unit of measurement that shows how effectively we're performing an activity, opportunity or lever that we've defined (see [child terms](/a-to-z/performance-measure/#child-terms)).

## Purpose

Success depends on lots of things working independently and in a chain at different levels. Performance measures let us see how effectively they're working at a granular level, so we can see where to improve and allocate more resources.
