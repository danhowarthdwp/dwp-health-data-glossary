## Definition

Data interoperability enables data services and products to interact and share data. 

The term tends to cover two main things: the digital protocols that allow for data exchange, and the data standards we follow to preserve compatibility while processing data. 

We enable interoperability through open or common technical standards, which create a shared protocol for the exchange of information.

## Purpose

The Digital Health and Disability Strategy says we design our services and ways of working with data flow in mind. Data needs to be connected between different services and the wider organisation. This is data interoperability in practice.
