## Definition

A data source is a place where data comes from. Data sources can be internal (for example, the data we gather in services) and external (for example, website performance data from Google Analytics).

## Purpose

Data sources must be appropriate for their intended use, reliable and authoritative. Always consider the limitations of a data source, and whether it has any potential biases, uncertainty or distortive effects. We manage our data sources rigorously in Health, and team Teal documents them on Jira, at different stages of use.
