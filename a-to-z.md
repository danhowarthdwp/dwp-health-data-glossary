## How to use the A to Z

The A to Z lists terms alphabetically. Where letters are missing, we've not defined a term that starts with that letter, yet.

This is a long page. To skip to a letter, append `#` and the letter to the URL in the address bar in your browser.

___

## A

### [Availability](/a-to-z/availability)

Data availability means having an environment where people have appropriate access to data, data is available for re-use (where appropriate), and there is efficient and safe flow of data between individuals and organisations. 

___

## D

### [Data](/a-to-z/data)

In general, data can be understood as discrete values and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. When we refer to data, we mean both data about people generated through their interactions with services, and also data about systems and infrastructure such as businesses and public services. Data can be operational (collected in the process of running services or businesses), as well as analytical and statistical.

### [Data quality](/a-to-z/data-quality)

Data quality is the state of qualitative or quantitative pieces of information. There are many definitions of data quality but data is generally considered high quality if it is fit for its intended uses in operations, decision making and planning. High quality quality data has integrity, which means it is accurate, complete and consistent.

### [Data source](/a-to-z/data-source)

A data source is a place where data comes from. Data sources can be internal (for example, the data we gather in services) and external (for example, website performance data from Google Analytics).

___

## I

### [Interoperability](/a-to-z/interoperability)

Data interoperability enables data services and products to interact and share data. The term covers the digital protocols that allow for data exchange, and the data standards we follow to preserve compatibility while processing data.

___

## L

### [Linked data](/a-to-z/linked-data)

Linked data is structured data that uses common standards and identifiers to allow multiple datasets to be used in conjunction with each other. It requires a common data model, and to follow technical and data standards that enable the use and interoperability of the data model.

___

## M

### [Measure](/a-to-z/measure)

A unit of measurement that shows if the work we're doing in a particular area is working. Can be a [performance measure](/a-to-z/#performance-measure) or a [results measure](/a-to-z/#results-measure).

### [Measurement](/a-to-z/measurement)

How we determine if the work we do is working.

### [Measurement framework](/a-to-z/measurement-framework)

A measurement framework is a blueprint that defines how objectives, actions and measurement are organised and interact within a business area. It consists of 2 parts, the connections between objectives and actions; and the 3 different types of measures â€“ performance measures, results measures and balancing measures. It does not contain metrics or data. 

### [Measurement plan](/a-to-z/measurement-plan)

Teams develop measurement plans specific to their own area. A measurement plan contains metric definitions (for performance, balancing and results measures); and how these link the processes, outcomes and unintended consequences with appropriate data sources for measurement, through hypotheses.

### [Metadata](/a-to-z/metadata)

Metadata is data about data. It's usually a set of data that describes contextual information on another set of data. It helps to organise, find, understand and manage data.

___

## P

### [Performance](/a-to-z/performance)

How effectively the things we set out to do are being done. Relates to team activities, opportunities and levers.

### [Performance measure](/a-to-z/performance-measure)

A unit of measurement that shows how effectively we're performing an activity, opportunity or lever that we've defined.

___

## R

### [Result](/a-to-z/result)

The impact and outcomes we deliver as a result of the work we have done.

### [Results measure](/a-to-z/results-measure)

A unit of measurement that shows if the work we deliver is meeting the impact and outcomes we've defined.

___

## W

### [Ways of working](/a-to-z/ways-of-working)

Ways of working are the activities and processes that teams perform to collaborate and create value. They're repeatable, shareable methods. Like services, we can design, evaluate and iterate them to improve their performance and meet the needs of people who use them.
